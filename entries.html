<h4>October 29
Day 1 of Investigation
Dr. Aurum</h4>

<p>I am actually grateful for being assigned head researcher in this case. It's an exciting one for sure, and I can't wait to solve it. Cursed cases have always fascinated me, and this is perhaps the most infamous one.</p>
<p>I have heard story upon story of the previous cases of death or insanity of the people assigned this case all over the country, and I have done some amateur sleuthing as a hobby, but to be assigned this case, to be given full control of this case…it means a lot to me.</p>
<p>The case revolves around the missing girl Rozaline Lewis Solum. Although she has been missing for decades now, she just vanished without a trace. According to all news articles, she had left behind a memoir through video tapes, but the tapes have never been transcribed into text, and after the previous sleuths have…gone crazy or died, the tapes just disappeared. I'm not sure whether I will find these tapes, but if I do, I will make sure to convert them to text immediately.</p>

<br>

<h4>November 8
Day 10 of Investigation
Dr. Aurum</h4>

<p>I have found them! After almost a month of searching everywhere possible, I found the tapes in a closet in the school! I don't know how I didn't find them yesterday, as I could have sworn I checked the closet, but regardless, I found them.</p>
<p>I also found a letter of sorts toward a person referred to as “Janice” and sent by a subject referred to as “Jikook”. One theory I have is that Jikook was involved in the case in a negative way. He mentions Rozaline as if he was with Rozaline for a long duration since she had been missing. He also brings up a character named “Matt”, though this may be a red herring. In fact, this letter may be a mislead, but it is the only solid evidence I have.</p>
<p>The recordings are…confusing, to say the least. Of the one that I am listening to, Rozaline is narrating a story, her story. However, the story has many…characteristics about it that suggest that she is making up many of the details. The narration seems real enough––Rozaline's pauses and breaks demonstrate that she hasn't read from any script––and the events before the “gray area” have been validated through our witnesses.</p>
<p>Presented is the letter. I will immediately commence converting the recordings into text.</p>

<h4>November 14
Day 16 of Investigation
Dr. Aurum</h4>

<p>Never mind what I said about this case. It is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Nothing makes any sense, nothing is connected…</p>
<p>But if anything, I’ve gotten more curious. I want to know what happened. I want to know where Rozaline is. She isn’t narrating her actual story, obviously. None of this is real. The Underground simply cannot exist according to the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Then how is this so fascinating? Why am I so interested in this case? It’s drawing me in, almost beckoning me to investigate it further.</p>
<p>I can’t help it. It’s so interesttting interestiing interesing fuck.</p>

<br>

<h4>Day 29 of Investigation
Dr. Aurum</h4>

<p>I have learned so much from this.</p>
<p>I don't know what to say.</p>
<p>I've started to hallucinate now.</p>
<p>I see great, golden, domed bildings buildings like the ones described in the audio clips.
<p>I see ravens the size of school buses and elephants the size of ants.
<p>I see staffs of oak and maple and silver wood that I cannot describe, and I see the pain in the bearers' eyes when a foreign creature touches the staffs.
<p>I see dead eyes on living people. I see glassy eyes on moving bodies that have lost control of their movement.
<p>And I'm scared.
<p>I don't knw know why. All of this is very obviously fake. None of this can occur in real life.
<p>And yet…
<p>And yet, it all seems so real.
<p>Is this what Jikook meant by “waking up”?
<p>If this is what it means…
	I’m not sure I want to wake up.




<h4>December 02
Dr. Aurum</h4>

I haven't slept for the last 5 days.
	I cannot.
	I started listening to the tapes again. The fourth tape has loud, scratching sounds and static at exactly 07:28 and this lasts for about 30 saconds. It scared me so much when I first heard if I had to stop the tape and take a walk to clear my mind.
	When I returned, I monaged to duplicate the recording and crop it so I was left with the scratching sound. I then messed with it, playing it in reverse, slowing it down, speeding it up, doing absolutally anything to get a hint or some sort of...I don't know wha what I was looking for. but I was looking for something.
	After I had slowed it down to a speed of ¼ its normal speed and reversed it, I heard a raspy voice––I couldn't identify the gender––that kept repeating something over and over again.
	"Don't listen to this. Please. Burn this. Burn this and leave us alone."
	This was repeated a total of seven times.
	I believe that this voice may be Rozaline's and that she somehow edited it.
	Or maybe...
	Maybe it's the person Jikook was addressing in his letter.
	 Maybe it's Maaµßç∆©ßµ∫ü˜ßÅ√éµe…





<h4>December 08
Dr. Aurum</h4>

Eight steady knocks
And I approach the door
Crackling fire on my left
Silver pencil to my right
Primavera Largo humming behind

The dog growls at the door
I reach out to the warm dusty knob
My hand shakes
I don't know who's outside
But I will not let him in

My vision passes through the guarded boundary
A man in dark robes impatiently stands
Grey fingers touch the battered knob
I brace myself, for I know
The door will not hold any longer



<h4>December 09
Dr. Aurum</h4>

I didn't write that poem. I don't write poetry. I don't keep silver pencils. I always keep the fireplace out. But it is my handwriting.
Did I write it and then forget? Did someone forge it and prank me with it? Is someone trying to scare me?
If so, it is working too well.
I overlooked my last entry. What is wrong with me? How could I not notice how many spellling mistakes there were in the entry? I’m a goddamn idiot. I’m stressed and high as fuck on caffeine, and I want to stop doing this. I can just tell Steven. Why can’t I tell him I can’t do this? It would de so easy if I could build the confidence to do that.
I'm afraid. I don't want to do this. But I can't back down now. Whoever is doing this, you cannot stop me from finding out what happened. I will know.
I must know.


<h4>December 11
Dr. Aurum</h4>

	There’s someone in my room.
	I don't know who they are, or what they are, but I know that they're there.
	I can feel them.
	And I see them out of the corner of my eye when I turn, when I blink…
	God, I hate this. I hate this so much.
	I feel like they are behind me, looking over my shoulder and watching me as I write, but I turn and no one's there.
	I feel like I'm going crazy, but I swear there's someone there. I swear to Go
	I saw the figure again. I can see it. It's trying to scare me, trying to frighten me into stopping. I can see that.
	But I won't stop. I have to know what happened. I must.
	Then again…
	Why am I so desperate to know? I can just tell Steven I simply canno
	No. I must continue even if it kills me.







<h4>December 13
Eleanor Aurum</h4>

	He's everywhere.
	I don't know what he is, I just know it's a him.
	He follows me, goes through my supplies…
	I haven't listened to the tapes for two days now, and he hasn't done anything.
	But I know he's there.
	He's always there.
	He's everywhere.
	Why can't he leave me alone?
	I want to know what happened to Rozaline. I must know whether my hallucinations are of real events or if i'm just imagining everything.
	I must know.
	Why doesn't he want me to know? Is he scared? Does he have anything to do with where Rozaline is?



<h4>December 14 or 16
Eleanor</h4>

I can't.
	I can feel myself losing it.
	I keep seeing a silver painted wooden pencil in my supplies and everywhere I go. I know for a fact that I don't have any silver pencils because I only keep yellow pencils. At one point, I picked it up and snapped it in half, but then something in my core started hurting so much I sank to the ground right then and there.
	And now I see him.
	I can see MåÅàÀthīas.
	Everywhere I go, I see him.
	I run away whenever I see him, but it's no use. He's always there.
	Always.





<h4>December something
Ellie</h4>

Rozaline is dead
Rozaline is stuck on an island in the middle of nowhere
Rozaline is still alive
Rozaline is in the stars
Rozaline never existed in the first place
Rozaline is still in the Underground, somewhere. I know she is.
But where is the Underground?
According to her context, it would be in Boston, Massachusetts
According to her context, it would be in the middle of the Pacific Ocean
According to her context, it would be in the far right of the fourth eye of a steatoda borealis
According to her context, it would be in the center of the Earth
According to her context, it would be in the Emma Dean crater of Mars
According to her context, it could be anywhere…
But who is Maaåa``àatThîaAÅasßs?
Ma††hiås is a ghost
MatˇT˙hiIas is nonexistent
MMµMatHÍîìasß is right behind me, watching my every movement
mMaThiîas is a monster who won’t leave me alone
MatHHi(I@s is a dumb son of a bitch who deserves to die

<h4>Can't remember</h4>

	Go away. Please, please go away. I'm begging you. I cannot do this anymore. I promise I won't listen to the tapes anymore. Just leave me alone. I'll do anything for you. I'll even put the tapes back where I found them. Just leave me alone.
