    <h3>It is the story you wish you never read.</h3>

    <p>Hi. This is the author. To all future authors...do not ever create characters that possess the ability to break the 4th wall. Understand that this will destroy your story. The characters that had the ability to see me ended up seeing me. Every single character that saw me ended up adding bits to the story to alter it to their benefit. I was able to thwart their alterations, creating the ending I wanted, but it came at a price. I was forced to alter the character arcs of these characters, thereby ruining the effect of what would have been an excellent addition to the world of literature. I do not know if they added anything else to the story, whether it be easter eggs to further the plot or messages to the readers. Who knows...there may be easter eggs in this very website.</p>
