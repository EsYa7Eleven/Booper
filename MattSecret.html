<p>Millions of cars pass b<div class=secrets>y</div> that abandoned house across the street. Millions of people walk by it every single day with barely a glance at the dismal condition of the small, gray house, much less acknowledge its ruin.
<p>The small boy with the ruined hair that once was a shiny blonde stumbles across the blackened, worn-down street with a half-curious thought--what if the people who passed that house every day knew the value of the knowledge inside that house? Would they still regard the house with a disdainful glance?</p>
<p>He stops at the door, almost hesitant. Had he been a couple of years younger, he wouldn’t have even paused before knocking on the dust-covered door. But now he is older, and he had learned some valuable lessons, ones he accidentally discovered.</p>
<p>If any of the Mages were out on the street right now, they wouldn’t recognize this ragged blonde boy with a torn cloak and scratches all over his body, desperately clutching a parcel tied with a brown string, but they would probably notice the black cloak with the blood-red streak on the interior. He was once a star of his school and the one he left behind, a role model who guided the ones under him to become powerful Mages who could do anything. Now he is just a shell of that old boy, one that lost to the very thing that propelled him to greatness.</p>
<p>The door opens slowly, emitting a foul, ‘old people’ smell that curls through the air like fog. The boy raises his pale blue eyes and fixes onto the old, gray, but still sharp eyes. The woman who stands across from him is one who still has a sense of clarity even this late into her life. The boy sees that clarity and yearns for that keen understanding of the world around him.</p>
<p>“Get out,” the woman breathes, releasing a bitter, citrus scent into the air. “I don’t want your newspapers.”</p>
<p>Without realizing what he is doing, the boy raises his arms and holds out the package. “Take it.”</p>
<p>“What is this?” The woman recoils from the bloody hands that grasp the parcel.</p>
<p>“He needs you to take it. I have been hiding it for too long.” He barely recognizes his voice; it is in much worse condition than the woman’s voice.</p>
<p>“Who? Who’s ‘he’?” The woman blinks, then shakes her head. “I don’t want anything. I’m fine here on my–”</p>
<p>“It is from Jikook.”</p>
<p>The boy steps back, knowing he woke something up in the woman’s mind. She pauses, her eyes turning as cold as ice, then steps back into her home. “I don’t know a Jikook.”</p>
<p>Please, Janice.” His voice takes a pleading tone. “Please, do it for him. He needs you to take it. I have been so bad, Janice. I have been so, so bad. I did not mean any of what I did--” his voice catches. “I swear I just got carried away. It was so much fun. Why was it fun? It should not have been fun at all. I spent so much time and energy planning out the last one, placing the parcel as evidence exactly where she would see it.” He takes a breath, knowing he was going off on a tangent but not caring. “It was spectacular, it was perfect, and it was the most grotesque thing I have ever seen. I degraded a person into a mindless zombie, Janice. Please; let me do something right.”</p>
<p>The woman eyes the boy, seemingly staring right into his soul–that black, dead thing that resided in his body–then reaches out a hand and snatches the blood-stained parcel away from the boy.</p>
<p>As it leaves the boy’s hands a final time, he vows to himself that the package will never enter his grasp again, that Janice will finally create the story that Jikook had always wanted. He smiles although the strain, that yearn he had mistaken for true love, pulled at his heart like a man tugging at a rope. He wishes Jikook could have been around to see this historic moment on the dilapidated street in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>He wishes Jikook was not away.</p>
